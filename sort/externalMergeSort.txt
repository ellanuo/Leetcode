You can do this pretty easily with a standard merge type algorithm.

Say you have 100 billion numbers and you want the top 10 billion. We'll say you can hold 1 billion numbers in memory at any time.

So you make a pass:

while not end of input
    read 1 billion numbers
    sort them in descending order
    save position of output file
    write sorted numbers to output file
You then have a file that contains 100 blocks of 1 billion numbers each. Each block is sorted in descending order.

Now create a max heap. Add the first number of each block to the heap. You'll also have to add the block number or the number's position in the file so that you can read the next number.

Then:

while num_selected < 10 billion
    selected = heap.remove()
    ++num_selected
    write selected to output
    read next number from the selected block and place on heap
There's a small bit of complexity involved, keeping track of which block the number came from, but it's not too bad.

The max heap never contains more than 100 items (basically, one item per block), so memory isn't an issue in the second pass. With a bit of work, you can avoid a lot of reads by creating a smallish buffer for each block so that you don't incur the cost of a disk read for every number that's selected.

It's basically just a disk merge sort, but with an early out.

Complexity of the first pass is b * (m log m), where b is the number of blocks and m is the number of items in a block. N, the total number of items in the file, is equal to b * m. Complexity of the second pass is k log b, where k is the number of items to select and b is the number of blocks.

This method is mainly an optimization of method 1. Instead of using temp[] array, use Min Heap.

Thanks to geek4u for suggesting this method.

1) Build a Min Heap MH of the first k elements (arr[0] to arr[k-1]) of the given array. O(k)

2) For each element, after the kth element (arr[k] to arr[n-1]), compare it with root of MH.
……a) If the element is greater than the root then make it root and call heapify for MH
……b) Else ignore it.
// The step 2 is O((n-k)*logk)

3) Finally, MH has k largest elements and root of the MH is the kth largest element.

Time Complexity: O(k + (n-k)Logk) without sorted output. If sorted output is needed then O(k + (n-k)Logk + kLogk)

All of the above methods can also be used to find the kth largest (or smallest) element.
